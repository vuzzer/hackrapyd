# Rapyd Hackathon
Our project aims to simplify the shopping process and improve the user's checkout experience based on advertising, games, stories and a conversation agent.

# What it does
With our solution, all the user's operations take place on a single page. This approach solves the problem of a long or complicated sales process. In addition, the addition of products to the shopping cart appears in a conversational agent (RapydBot) to give a quick view of the added products. The user makes his payment without redirection. The storyPay, gamingPay and adversitingPay implemented in order to improve the user's shopping experience.

## **RapydBot**
A conversation agent that actively reminds the user that they have products waiting to be purchased (flashing dot, message in modal when a product is first added).  

## **StoryPay**
presents the most popular items. The customer can buy these products with one click. Without a search, the user can buy the product he wants.

## **AdversitingPay**
It is an advertisement displaying a product with a discount and disappears after a short time. This encourages the user to be active on the platform in order to benefit from product discounts.

## **GamingPay**
 Allows the user to enjoy discounts on purchases by playing a game. The advantage is to allow the customer to be entertained while buying products.
